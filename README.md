# solid-dollop: MMLI Code Spielereien

Author: FK

name is github-suggestion

### VL02: Whittaker-Henderson Implementation

### VL08: Lee Carter model

### VL10: Deep Neural Networks
Tried to translate the R-Code provided in the slides and Ronald & Wuethrich to Python (as I really despise R language) with huge help of Copilot

### VL11: Convolutional Neural Networks
Tried to do the same thing as in VL10. HOwever, I don't get what the "rates" are. No idea, really.
